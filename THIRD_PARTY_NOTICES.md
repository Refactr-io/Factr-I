Hermes Agent security-guidance plugin

licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.

    Source:    https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official

Forked content
--------------

The file patterns.py in this directory is a verbatim copy of the upstream
patterns.py at the commit above, with a modified module docstring noting
this attribution. The pattern data — 25 regex/substring rules covering
unsafe deserialization, command injection, XSS sinks, crypto footguns,
XXE, GitHub Actions injection, and TLS-verification disablement — is
unmodified.

Original work
-------------

The Hermes-side plugin glue code (__init__.py, plugin.yaml, README.md,
tests) is original work by NousResearch and is licensed under the MIT
License that applies to the rest of the hermes-agent project, except
where it imports from patterns.py — that import does not change the
license of either file.

## Bundled fonts

The fonts in `desktop/app/src/fonts/` are licensed under the SIL Open Font
License, Version 1.1. The full text accompanies each family:

- Pretendard Std Variable and IBM Plex Mono: full license text in the sections below and in
  `desktop/app/src/fonts/{pretendard,ibm-plex-mono}/OFL.txt`

## Other bundled material

- `backend/native/fts5_cjk/vendor/sqlite3.h`, `sqlite3ext.h`: SQLite, public domain.
- Skills and plugins carrying their own `LICENSE` files keep them beside the component.
- The wake-word models in `backend/tools/wakewords/` were trained with the
  openWakeWord pipeline (Apache-2.0); see the README there.

## rtk (bundled command-line tool)

Release builds ship the `rtk-oss` build of rtk 1.0.1 (https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk), copyright RTK AI
Labs, licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (full text in `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`; the
licence file shipped with the binary is `resources/factr/RTK-LICENSE`). It is an unmodified upstream
binary, pinned by sha256 and verified against the release's `checksums.txt` at build time. It is only run
when the "Shorten command output" setting is on, with telemetry disabled. The non-`oss` rtk builds
include a separately licensed component and are not used.

## Apache-2.0 licensed bundled skills

The following bundled skills declare `license: Apache-2.0` in their SKILL.md
front matter: `backend/optional-skills/creative/hyperframes`,
`backend/optional-skills/creative/impeccable`, and the finance skills
`3-statement-model`, `comps-analysis`, `dcf-model`, `excel-author`,
`lbo-model`, `merger-model` and `pptx-author` under
`backend/optional-skills/finance/`. The full text of the Apache License,
Version 2.0 is in `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`.

SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
Software, subject to the following conditions:

1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the

permission.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
remain under this license does not apply to any document created
using the Font Software.

TERMINATION
This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
not met.
