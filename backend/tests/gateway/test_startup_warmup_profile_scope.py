"""Boot probes run inside the launch profile's scope under multiplex.

``get_tool_definitions`` runs every ``check_fn``; a probe reads a routing override
through ``agent.secret_scope.get_secret``.
With multiplex active and no scope on the executor thread that read fails closed, the override is
absent and a credential could be sent to the wrong endpoint. The warm-up
must run under the same binding a routed turn gets, and the binding must reach the executor thread.
